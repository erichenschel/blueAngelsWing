       "  'summary': 'For many investors\\' this week, it\\'s is all about the earnings reports from a pair of technology heavyweights. But at the outset of a new trading month, May\\'s best tech stocks to buy and short have little to do with the headlines and a lot to do with durable big picture opportunities, both off and on the price charts.Depending on where one\\'s attention is during this first trading session of May, the broader markets are sending up a mayday signal (pun intended). Trade tensions between the US and China tied to novel coronavirus squabbling certainly haven\\'t helped investors. But much of the blame lands squarely on the shoulders of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) following \"mixed\" and \"disappointing\" quarterly results.Apple is off 0.5% as investors focus on slower revenue growth and the company\\'s decision to suspend guidance for the June quarter due to Covid-19 related uncertainty. That said, overnight losses have loosened their grip on the stock. Upbeat comments from Tim Cook regarding a worldwide recovery from the pandemic may be persuading investors to pull up their bootstraps.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTrillion dollar-plus and tech stock peer Amazon is shedding a more decisive 6.50% after topping forecasts. Catching Wall Street\\'s attention, CEO Jeff Bezos announced a bold and costly new initiative in which the company will spend the \\'entirety\\' of its $4 billion in second quarter profits to fortify its position in today\\'s and tomorrow\\'s post-coronavirus world.  * 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades Unsurprisingly, the broad-based, large cap S&P; 500 is down by roughly 2% as the two tech giants shares were re-evaluated and digested following their respective announcements. Still, while many investors are allowing Friday\\'s heavier-than-usual, tech heavyweights to do their bidding, the new calendar month is ushering in fresh, longer-term opportunities for trading on other tech stocks:  * Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL)  * Spotify (NYSE:SPOT)  * Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU)These stocks represent opportunities for both bulls and bears in the sector. Tech Stocks to Trade: Oracle (ORCL)  Source: Charts by TradingViewOracle is the first of our tech stocks to trade. This weeks\\' earnings headlines have shares under sympathetic pressure. But make no mistake, this enterprise software / cloud play\\'s shares are not only far from out, they\\'re a definite \"buy.\"Since putting together a market-leading bottom in early March after delivering its own narrow quarterly beat, shares of Oracle have worked to solidify the monthly chart\\'s long-term uptrend. Now, while some stocks cry for mercy, Oracle stock is screaming \"buy\"to anyone willing to pay attention.Bottom-line, strong technical supports from a bullish stochastics crossover out of oversold territory, monthly chart hammer confirmation,and the opportunity to buy shares near the candle buy point on today\\'s pullback make Oracle a clear winner. Spotify (SPOT)  Source: Charts by TradingViewThe next name on our list of tech stocks to trade is Spotify stock. Similar to Oracle, the streaming music giant\\'s shares are a favored purchase due to an earnings beat on strong subscriber growth delivered earlier this week, plus confirmation from the monthly stock chart.Technically, Spotify shares affirmed an undercut variation of a double bottom pattern within a larger bullishly-tilted channel this week on the heels of quarterly results. Unlike Oracle, I\\'d recommend investors hold off on this tech stock and wait for a \\'second attempt\\' buy signal.A purchase should only be considered if the price action Spotify stock above $152 and slightly back above April\\'s pattern pivot high. This entry is focused on getting on board as price momentum takes hold.With stochastics crossing over just beneath overbought territory, I\\'m anticipating the weaker channel\\'s resistance is about to be broken and Spotify stock will take on more bullish leadership.  * 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades Given the company\\'s dominant industry position, shares still relatively new to the market and nice growth prospects to build its brand and eventually profits as well, there\\'s more than a bit of interesting support for this outlook to take shape. Roku (ROKU)  Source: Charts by TradingViewThe last of our tech stocks to trade are shares of Roku. I\\'m a fan, as well as an early adopter of the over-the-top streaming platform, though I eventually pulled the plug on cable with the company\\'s original device more than several years ago. But as a trader in search of investing opportunities, Roku stock looks risky near-term.Technically, after enjoying a big-time rally from corrective lows, shares have that \"mayday\" look about them. The stock has hit downtrend channel resistance and simultaneously challenged the 62% retracement level from last September\\'s all-time-high. At the same time, stochastics are just now entering overbought territory and shares have confirmed a weekly doji topping pattern.Bottom-line, Roku looks more well-suited for bearish positioning. However, earnings are next week so I\\'d highly recommend limited-risk options strategies in lieu of shorting shares.Still, unless the price chart is telling us fabricated stories, until shares are closer to that other bottom-line on the price chart, Roku is better for watching Netflix (NASAQ:NFLX) or Disney (NYSE:DIS) programs than in your investment account as a long.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler\\'s management does not own any securities mentioned in this article.

       "  'summary': \"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was having a good run of things through 2019 and into 2020. Despite continuing to lose ground to rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), ongoing processor production challenges, new vulnerabilities in its chips, and abandoning its 5G smartphone modem business, Intel stock performed well.Source: canon_shooter / Shutterstock.com Between the start of 2019 and its high point this January, INTC gained 46%. At $58.75, Intel has recovered much of the ground it lost during the March market sell-off, but does it have room for a full recovery -- or even further growth -- in 2020?The biggest challenge the company faces in 2020 is shaping up to be global PC sales. With the novel-coronavirus impacting everything from supply chains to retail store closures, PC sales are getting clobbered. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips PC Sales Experience Biggest Drop Since 2013One of the reasons for Intel's performance over the past year was the unexpected return to growth of PC sales. The final three quarters of 2019 saw PC shipments increase after years of decline or flat demand. Obviously, this was good news for Intel stock, even if the company was battling with an aggressive AMD to maintain market share.  * 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades That good news came to a crashing halt in Q1 2020. According to Gartner, the coronavirus pandemic disrupted both supply and demand for computers. The result was a 12.3% year-over-year decline in PC shipments. That's the steepest quarterly drop since 2013.In an earlier report, Gartner also projected that global PC shipments will continue their decline through 2020, 2021 and 2022. This was due largely to the fact that the bump in sales from consumers switching to Windows 10 has largely run its course.   Intel's Q1Last week, Intel delivered its first quarter earnings report. The company delivered solid numbers that beat estimates, including adjusted per-share earnings up 62.92% year-over-year, and a 22.98% increase in revenue. Despite the earnings and revenue beats, INTC stock immediately dropped in after-hours trading. Concerns include the prospect of lower margins and the potential hit to sales if the economy contracts. AMD Warns About Coronavirus ImpactIntel's computer processor rival AMD reported its own quarterly earnings this week. AMD says it continues to gain marketshare against Intel in the PC market, but issued revenue guidance for Q2 that was lower than analysts had expected. The company also delivered commentary about how the coronavirus pandemic could impact sales for the rest of 2020 (via Bloomberg):While demand indicators across commercial, education and data center infrastructure markets are strong, we expect some softness in consumer demand in the second half of the year depending on how overall macro-economic conditions evolve.The same issue that AMD is concerned about -- a post-coronavirus recession triggering a slowdown in consumer PC sales -- is also applicable to Intel.  What About Data Centers?Both Intel and AMD have spiked out cloud computing and data centers as an area where growth is expected to continue. Given the load that cloud services -- from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) -- have been under during the coronavirus lockdown, a big short-term sales bump in their server chips is almost inevitable. However, it may be more than just a bump. After several years of slowing sales, cloud service providers began buying new hardware in earnest as 2019 wound down.The challenge for Intel will once again be Advanced Micro Devices. AMD is aggressively pushing its EPYC processors, which are beginning to win a bigger share of the data center market. Last November, AMD scored a big win on that front when its latest EPYC processors were adopted by Chinese internet giant Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). Bottom Line on Intel StockIntel's Jan. 24 close of $68.47 was its highest since the dotcom bubble burst. And the factors that powered it to that level are questionable in the coronavirus aftermath.At its current $58.75, most analysts feel Intel stock has little upside over the next 12 months. Among those polled by CNN Money, the average price target of $62 offered just 4% growth potential.In other words, there's little obvious gain in jumping onboard the Intel train at the moment. Nor is there any compelling reason to sell your shares. With the long-term ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic still unknown, now is probably a time to take a wait-and-see approach on Intel. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

       "  'summary': 'Did you know that while financial markets have plunged amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, everyone has been looking for stocks to buy?Search interest related to \"stocks to buy\" has surged to all-time highs in March and April. Millennial investors trading stocks on Robinhood increased their buying activity by 60% in March. And corporate insider buying activity surged to record highs in March, too.In other words, everyone and their best friend bought the stock market dip in March.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd they\\'ve made out well. The S&P; 500 is up more than 30% from its mid-March lows.What now? Is time to take profits? Or look for more stocks to buy?  * 9 of the Best Food Stocks to Buy Right Now To answer those questions, let\\'s consider the five following observations:  * Stocks are priced for a near-perfect recovery right now. A near-perfect recovery won\\'t happen. The economic re-opening in May will be choppy. That chop will cause broader market turbulence.  * On all fronts, the coronavirus pandemic is trending in the right direction. Cases are going down. New science points to a lower death rate than originally thought. An effective treatment is close to being approved. Vaccine trials are underway.  * About 20% of Americans have lost their jobs during Covid-19. But another 80% still have their jobs, aren\\'t spending money and have tons of free capital to deploy once the storm passes.  * The economic data isn\\'t pretty, but corporate America data has come in much better than feared. Things should only get better from here.  * Strong long-term, big-picture fundamentals imply that the stock market will finish the year on a high note. Thus, any near-term dip in stocks in May or June is a great time to look for stocks to buy.Here\\'s a deeper look into each. Expect a May SelloffSource: Shutterstock I\\'ve been bullish on this stock market recovery for the past six weeks. But I also acknowledge that stocks don\\'t take the elevator up. They take the staircase up, meaning that it\\'s a choppy ride higher. Right now, we are due for some chop.As of this writing, the Nasdaq is a stones throw away from being up year to date, while many high-quality growth stocks are right back to their pre-Covid-19 highs. That\\'s right. Despite everything that\\'s happened in 2020, many stocks are acting like it\\'s all over.It\\'s not all over. I\\'m optimistic that we will get through this crisis, and sooner, rather than later. But right now, stocks are broadly priced for a smooth economic re-opening in May.That won\\'t happen. The re-opening of the economy in May will be choppy. Consumers will remain hesitant to go out. Restaurants and stores will be operating at fractional capacity. Any rise in cases -- which will likely happen -- will cause delays and setbacks in the re-opening process.All in all, the re-opening of the U.S. economy in May will be anything but smooth. Stocks are \"smoothly\" priced today. That discrepancy could cause weakness in markets over the next few weeks. Covid-19 Trends Are PositiveSource: Antipina Daria/Shutterstock.com When it comes to the science and data surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, everything is trending in the right direction.The number of new daily cases reported each day is declining in every major country. So is the number of new daily deaths reported in every major country. In other words, social distancing measures are working, and the spread of the virus is materially slowing.Simultaneously, new science from a handful of antibody tests across the U.S. and Europe show that many, many more people have Covid-19 than previously thought. Those studies estimate that somewhere between 3% and 20% of the population in different areas have had Covid-19. If this new science holds up, then it would imply that Covid-19 is only fractionally more deadly than the seasonal flu.And that was before we had an effective treatment. Today, it increasingly appears that Gilead\\'s (NASDAQ:GILD) remdesivir is an effective treatment for the novel coronavirus. If so, then mass distribution of remdesivir will help lower Covid-19\\'s true death rate to levels equal to or potentially even below that of the flu.  * 10 Dow Jones Stocks to Keep Your Portfolio Afloat Given all these favorable developments on the coronavirus pandemic front, I fully expect the U.S. to survive this crisis with much less damage than initially anticipated, and overcome it much quicker than initially expected. Needless to say, that\\'s a good thing for U.S. stocks. Tons of Consumer FirepowerSource: Shutterstock There is a strong argument circulating that, even if we do \"beat back\" the virus quicker than expected, we still have a huge unemployment problem to deal with. This loss of employment (and consumer spending firepower) will weigh on the economic and stock market recovery for several months.But here\\'s the counter-argument, which I think holds much more water.Yes, 20% of Americans have lost their jobs over the past few weeks. But the other 80% haven\\'t. Those other 80% are receiving their normal salaries, just got $1,200 checks from the government, and aren\\'t spending money, i.e., their savings and checking accounts are just growing and growing.So, by the time the economy starts \"normalizing,\" one of out every five Americans will have very limited (if any) consumption firepower. The other four will have \"super-charged\" consumption firepower.Sure, in order to unleash that firepower into actual spending, you need consumer sentiment to flip to not being deathly afraid of the virus. But as the science continues to change to show that Covid-19 isn\\'t as deadly as originally thought, as spread continues to slow, and as an effective treatment gets rolled out, consumer sentiment will flip.When it does, we will unlock a ton of pent-up consumer spending firepower -- the likes of which will offset the loss of firepower from 20% unemployment. Corporate Numbers Will Only Get BetterSource: Shutterstock The economic data today isn\\'t pretty. But the corporate America data isn\\'t too bad.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) just reported strong earnings, propelled by sustained robust cloud services demand. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) also reported strong earnings recently on the back of strong cloud demand.Facebook\\'s (NASDAQ:FB) earnings were better-than-expected, and the company said that ad spending trends -- while down -- are starting to stabilize. Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) all said something similar.Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported record deliveries and strong profits this quarter. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) topped estimates in its quarter. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) said that comparable sales declines in the U.S. are stabilizing, and improving in China. McDonald\\'s (NYSE:MCD) sounded a similar tone, saying that comparable sales trends globally have started to improve over recent weeks.All in all, business trends are starting to get better -- and they will only keep getting better.It increasingly appears the worst of Covid-19 happened in March and April. In May, June and July, we will re-open the economy, equipped with more knowledge about the virus, an effective treatment, and ample PPE to accommodate an uptick in hospitalizations.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week As business trends continue to improve in the coming months, stocks should maintain a broader uptrend. Stocks Will Trend HigherSource: Shutterstock When you look at the numbers, it becomes clear that stocks have healthy upside potential over the next six to twelve months.As go profits, so go stocks. Corporate profits in 2020 will get slammed, since March and April business activity ground to a halt. But it looks like business activity will start picking back up in May, and stage a meaningful recovery in the summer. By the second-half of 2020, it\\'s very likely that corporate sales and profits get back to growing again on a year-over-year basis. Thereafter, throughout 2021, corporate profit growth should be quite robust, as an approved vaccine allows us to put Covid-19 in the rear-view mirror and tons of stimulus powers strong consumer and enterprise spending.Big picture: corporate profits will drop in 2020, but not by as much as feared, and then rebound in 2021 by quite a bit.My modeling suggests that a reasonable estimate for 2021 S&P; 500 earnings per share is $170 or higher. Based on an 18-times forward earnings multiple -- an appropriate multiple for the market today consider that interest rates are at zero -- that implies a 2020 price target for the S&P; 500 of 3,060… or higher. Consider These Stocks to BuySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.com Zooming out, I believe that most data today points to a May/June retreat in the stock market, followed by a big second-half surge to levels above 3,000 on the S&P; 500.So, if you\\'re looking for stocks to buy, I\\'d do some profit-taking here to get some dry-powder, and deploy that dry-powder on the next big market dip.  * 7 U.S. Stocks to Buy on Coronavirus Weakness If/when that market dip does come, what are the best stocks to buy? I\\'d take a good hard look at these 10 best growth stocks to buy for the next 10 years:  * Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)  * The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD)  * Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  * Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU)  * Square (NYSE:SQ)  * Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA)  * Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND)  * Chegg (NASDAQ:CHGG)  * Facebook  * PinterestLuke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

       "  'summary': 'Square (NYSE:SQ) enters its first-quarter earnings call next week in an interesting position for SQ stock.Source: Shutterstock As a payment processor, Square is one of those companies that will be most affected by the downturn of mom-and-pop businesses, food trucks and other small companies that are hurting from the novel coronavirus.But when you look at the big picture, you see that SQ stock is perfectly positioned for the inevitable recovery, and that the company\\'s two-pronged business plan is ideal for the 21st century.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades Square is scheduled to report earnings on May 6. Let\\'s take a closer look at this innovative payment processor. SQ Stock at a GlanceAt one point this February, Square was flying high, up more than 35%. Then the U.S. started getting confirmed coronavirus cases and businesses began shutting down as social distancing became the norm. Suddenly Square was looking at a 40% loss.Fortunately for investors, those peaks and valleys are starting to balance out. SQ is up about 1% year-to-date.Fourth-quarter earnings released in February were a big winner, with adjusted earnings up 64% to 23 cents per share, versus 14 cents per share a year ago. Analysts had expected EPS of 21 cents.Net revenue was $1.31 billion, an year-over-year increase of 41% from the $933 million SQ recorded a year ago. The company\\'s revenue also beat what analysts\\' projected, which was $1.186 billion.Square issued rosy 2020 guidance of revenue between $5.9 billion and $5.96 billion, with adjusted EBITDA between $500 million and $520 million. Both of those also beat analysts\\' forecasts of $5.61 billion revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $539.4 million.All that was great. Then the coronavirus happened. Square and the CoronavirusSquare is known for its (not coincidentally) plastic square dongles that are designed to fit neatly in a smartphone or tablet, turning them instantly into a payment processor that can handle most major credit cards.It\\'s the perfect 21st-century solution to anyone running a business, including pop-up stores, landscaping, food trucks, or small companies. According to a survey from the National Federation of Independent Business, the pandemic has hurt nearly 75% of small businesses.In the fourth quarter, 45% of Square\\'s overall volume came from businesses with less than $125,000 annualized gross payment volume. So Square is going to be disproportionately injured by any event that hurts small business.Raymond James analyst John Davis cut his rating on SQ stock from \"market perform\" to \"underperform\" in mid-April, noting that payment volumes could be down as much as 60%.Because of the coronavirus, last month Square revised its first-quarter guidance, adjusting it downward to a net revenue range of $1.3 billion to $1.34 billion. Profits are expected in the range of $515 million to $525 million.The company also said it expects to report an EPS loss for the first quarter, and withdrew its 2020 full-year guidance.Analysts will be watching Square closely when it steps up to the earnings microphone on May 6. But even as numbers are destined to disappoint in the short-term, SQ can still be a solid company headed into the second half of 2020. SQ Does Fintech the Right WaySquare\\'s point-of-sale payment processing system is just one way it makes money. There\\'s also the Square Cash app, which is a direct competitor to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and is seeing fast growth of its own.Square Cash allows people to transfer money via their smartphones. At the end of  2019 Square Cash had 24 million active users, compared to PayPal\\'s 52 million active users of the Venmo app.Square Cash also features the Cash Card, which works like a debit card and allows customers to invest in anything from stocks to bitcoin.The Square Cash app represented more than $450 million of SQ\\'s $1.4 billion in revenue in 2019, but company officials think that\\'s just the tip of the iceberg. According to an investor presentation, SQ believes Square Cash is tapping into a $60 trillion market, and is just scratching the surface with a 2% penetration so far. The Bottom Line on Square StockSquare stock was growing fast before the coronavirus, but it\\'s also ideally situated to help small businesses recover as the virus begins to fade away.Already, the stock is beginning its long climb higher, and while first-quarter earnings will be a disappointment, I\\'ll be more interested in hearing about Square\\'s forecast for the second half of the year.SQ stock has a \"B\" rating today in my Portfolio Grader.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett. In his latest feat, Louis discovered the \"Master Key\" to profiting from the biggest tech revolution of this (or any) generation.

       "  'summary': '(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve revamped its Main Street Lending Program in ways that will allow battered oil companies to qualify for the aid after industry allies lobbied the Trump administration for changes.Larger, more heavily indebted companies can now qualify and use the money to pay off prior loans under the changes the central bank announced Thursday.The move opens the door to more oil and gas producers, said Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, who had pressed the administration on the issue as energy companies struggle to survive an epic collapse in fuel demand and crude prices.“With the decrease in demand and oversupply due to the global oil price war creating a valley for these highly leveraged companies, this expansion will help them bridge the gap as we look to reopen America,” Cramer said in an emailed statement Thursday.Environmentalists blasted the shifts they said rewarded oil companies that took on too much debt and were overproducing crude even before the coronavirus pandemic caused demand to plunge.“These changes directly reflect demands from polluters and their favorite members of Congress,” said Lukas Ross with the environmental group Friends of the Earth. “Long before the coronavirus, the drillers were in deep trouble. Now frackers want to pay back their debts with our money. Trump’s big oil bailout must be stopped.”For weeks, oil industry advocates have warned the original program structure would prevent battered drillers from accessing capital under the program.Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, and the Independent Petroleum Association of America argued oil companies needed more flexibility to use Main Street loans to repay existing debt -- something that was previously off limits but will now be allowed under some conditions.“Banks are frozen, so I think this is the only hope to see businesses underwrite expansion or to recapitalize between now and the end of the third quarter,” said Dan Eberhart, the chief executive of oil-field services company Canary Drilling Services, which has furloughed about 200 people and implemented across-the-board salary cuts.Maximum loan totals under the Main Street program are also being hiked to $200 million -- from an earlier $150 million cap viewed as too low to help oil producers.The Fed said the changes were not targeted to the oil and gas industry or any industry in particular but followed additional research into what slice of U.S. companies don’t have ready access to capital markets.Nevertheless, the new terms are likely to open it up to a wider group of energy firms, and overseers worried the Fed was bending to pressure.“The major changes announced today mirror the top requests of the oil and gas industry,” said Bharat Ramamurti, a member of the congressional panel appointed to scrutinize implementation of the Fed’s and part of the Treasury’s virus-relief programs.“That raises questions about how the changes promote the broader public interest -- especially when these companies will still have no real obligation to retain or rehire their workers,” Ramamurti said on Twitter.Credit RatingsEven before the changes, oil and gas companies with investment-grade credit ratings could secure funding through a separate program, the Fed’s Primary and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities.However, under term sheets released April 9, funding was restricted to firms that had credit ratings of at least BBB-/Baa3 as of March 22 -- a cutoff date that could come too late for some oil producers, such as Occidental Petroleum Corp., which had its debt cut to junk by Moody’s on March 18, with Fitch and S&P; following on March 20 and March 25, respectively.Republicans have argued that funding should be available to oil companies with credit ratings that slipped amid the coronavirus pandemic and a surge in crude unleashed by a Russia-Saudi Arabia battle for market share.On Thursday, the Fed said lenders now will be able to apply their “industry-specific expertise and underwriting standards to best measure a borrower’s income.”Highly leveraged companies also can take advantage of a new, third loan option that comes with increased risk sharing by lenders.It was not clear Thursday whether the changes would allow Occidental to qualify for aid -- or whether potentially newly eligible oil companies would seek it. Occidental declined to comment on the matter.The Fed’s approach to tweaking the Main Street loan program avoids creating an oil industry-specific initiative that could be unpopular with the public or require approval from Congress, where Democrats are deeply opposed.Fed emergency facilities are by law required to be broad-based, which in the central bank’s view prohibits lending aid to specific industries.The oil industry itself has been split over government aid targeted to the sector. While some smaller, independent producers and their trade groups have clamored for government loans, the idea of industry-targeted aid has drawn resistance from larger, multinational oil companies better able to ride the rout as well as their top lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute.Industry opponents of targeted loans are concerned that taking taxpayer money now could cost them political capital in Washington and be used by drilling foes against the sector later.“You can’t have capitalism on the way up and socialism on the way down,” said American Petroleum Institute Senior Vice President Frank Mariachi. “The role of the government is to provide appropriate economic stabilization across the economy. We do not think the role of the government is to become the private economy.”(Updates with new details, from 11th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

       "  'summary': '(Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett calls his annual meeting a high point of the year. It’s a time when Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholders converge on Nebraska to eat Dairy Queen ice cream, sample See’s Candies and, most importantly, hear the wit and wisdom of one of the world’s most successful investors.The booths offering sweet treats will be missing on Saturday, as will the tens of thousands of attendees. Even the location is being kept under wraps. But Buffett and a top deputy, Greg Abel, will be there, doing their best in a virtual meeting to make sense of an economy upended by the coronavirus pandemic.Even without the event’s usual trappings, interest is, if anything, even more intense than usual. Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, has been relatively quiet over the past month as the global response to the pandemic escalated, drawing questions about his view of what might be in store for the markets, Berkshire’s businesses and the global economy.“The tone will be different,” said Richard Cook, a shareholder who has missed just two meetings since attending his first in 1997. “I’ll certainly miss all these chances to see all those friends.”Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said this year’s event will likely lack “the celebratory feel that it had in the past.”There’s clearly very little to celebrate with the world in lockdown. In one of Buffett’s only public comments since the outbreak caused companies and communities to shut down across the U.S., the CEO in March called oil volatility and the panic hitting markets a “big one-two punch.”His Berkshire Hathaway has likewise stayed in the shadows, a contrast to the financial crisis in 2008, when the Omaha-based company dipped into its vast cash reserves to gain lucrative preferred shares and rescue businesses teetering on the edge of collapse.Buffett, now with roughly $128 billion in cash, hasn’t announced any large public deals even as the S&P; 500 tumbled 20% in the first quarter.Charlie Munger, a Berkshire vice chairman who in normal years fields questions at the meeting with Buffett, offered one explanation in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in early April. The conglomerate wants to come out of the coronavirus “typhoon” with lots of liquidity, Munger said, adding that many corporate executives are frozen in place as they try to figure out how to handle the crisis.Berkshire’s phone isn’t ringing off the hook, he told the newspaper.Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research, said it’s possible Berkshire will still make a move. “But the other thing is, when you have the government becoming the lender of last resort, you don’t necessarily need Berkshire to be the lender of last resort,” she said.Berkshire plans to start its event at 3:45 p.m. Omaha time on Saturday, with Buffett and Abel fielding questions shareholders sent to three hand-picked journalists. The company is set to release first-quarter results earlier that day.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“The decline in Berkshire’s equity portfolio was about $66 billion at quarter end, and a steep drop in Berkshire’s stock increases the potential for buybacks.”-Analysts Matthew Palazola and Derek Han-Click here for the researchThe company warned that the pair would steer clear of political questions and discussions about specific holdings at the meeting, which has morphed from a small gathering in the lunchroom of one of Buffett’s insurers into a sprawling event the billionaire has called a “Woodstock for Capitalists.”Follow Bloomberg’s TopLive blog on Saturday for the meeting.Here are some of the topics that might come up:StocksThe company’s first-quarter earnings report will give investors a better sense of whether Buffett and his investing deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, found opportunities in the turmoil caused by the virus.Berkshire’s quarterly filing usually discloses how much in stocks the company purchased during the quarter and the total size of the investment portfolio, including its largest holdings. Berkshire recently disclosed that it pared back stakes in Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co.OccidentalBuffett’s bet on Occidental Petroleum Corp., made just before his annual meeting last year, may draw questions. The oil producer slashed its common stock dividend in March for the first time in three decades as the plunge in oil prices weighed on the company.As part of Buffett’s investment, Berkshire obtained preferred stock that helped finance Occidental’s $37 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. That investment pays a hefty 8% annual dividend. But Occidental recently opted to pay Berkshire’s quarterly dividend in shares rather than cash as the company looks for ways to conserve funds. In some ways, the Berkshire dividend that Occidental has to meet has ended up leaving others worse off, according to KBW’s Shields.“I certainly don’t think that was the intention, but I think it may be a bit of a discouragement from some people looking at Berkshire capital and saying, ‘Hey, this is expensive, but it’s got this great ringing endorsement,’ because that’s not how it’s working out,” Shields said.Berkshire’s also been building a common stock investment in Occidental, a stake that was valued at about $780 million at the end of 2019.Insurance ClaimsChubb Ltd. CEO Evan Greenberg had a stark warning about the effect of the pandemic and shutdowns: It will likely be the largest event in insurance-industry history because it affects both sides of the balance sheet.Berkshire owns a collection of companies in the industry, with some that offer commercial-property insurance, workers’ compensation coverage and health-care liability policies. And some of its companies are reinsurers, which essentially write policies for other insurers.Auto insurers, such as Berkshire’s Geico, have actually returned some funds or offered premium credits to consumers as driving decreases, which could translate into fewer accidents. The industry may also see potential claims from canceled events and workers’ compensation insurance.“It’s so different based on the insurance product line,” Shields said. “There are some lines that have major questions,” especially with business-interruption coverage.Succession QuestionsBuffett, 89, and Munger, 96, routinely field questions about succession at the conglomerate. Berkshire’s decision in early 2018 to appoint Abel and Ajit Jain to the board was part of a movement to address succession, Buffett said at the time.Still, both Abel and Jain have remained behind the scenes to some extent, tending to Berkshire’s collection of businesses. Buffett told investors in this year’s annual letter that the pair would field more questions at this year’s annual meeting. But now only Abel, who lives closer to Omaha, will join Buffett at the event.“It’s really, really important,” Shields said. While there’s no indication that any change would happen now, “at some point in time, it’s not just that one of these guys takes over for Warren Buffett, it’s that maybe one of these guys takes over for Warren Buffett in a period of unprecedented change.”Pandemic FalloutCoronavirus fallout will hit Berkshire in varying ways. See’s Candies began furloughing workers in early April due to the shutdown of its stores. On the other hand, analysts at UBS Group AG expect an improvement in BNSF’s margins in the first quarter.Munger told the Wall Street Journal that Berkshire will probably have to shut some small businesses, though the story didn’t name any specific units.Still, Berkshire’s breadth -- with businesses in energy and retail and industrial operations -- gives the conglomerate a sense of the broader economy, especially through units such as the railroad, BNSF.“Buffett has access to a set of data about the U.S. economy through all of his subsidiaries,” Cook said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

The company said it decided to curtail production “in response to unacceptably low oil prices resulting from global oil demand destruction caused by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with a global oversupply of oil.” The company will ramp down production in late May. Any extensions past June will be determined on a monthly basis, the Houston-based company said. Operation of the 800-mile, trans-Alaska pipeline was not expected to be affected. “At this time, based on our current outlook, we chose to maintain organization capacity so we can resume programs in the future,” company spokeswoman Natalie Lowman said in an email to The Associated Press. ConocoPhillips had been producing about 218,000 barrels a day during the first quarter of the year. ”The curtailment will essentially leave the oil stored in the reservoirs, available for resumption of production at a later date,” the company’s statement said, explaining its actions “underscore the extraordinary challenges currently facing the oil and natural gas industry in Alaska and elsewhere.” Production curtailments will be made at the company's Kuparuk River unit and the Greater Mooses Tooth and Colville River units on the western North Slope. The reduction announcement came after four Alaska oil field service companies alerted state officials that they will lay off nearly 300 workers at their North Slope operations after oil prices crashed and drilling activity declined because of the pandemic.

       "  'summary': 'HOUSTON (AP) — Oilfield services giant Halliburton has closed down two sites in Texas and laid off 240 employees in Oklahoma in response to reduced customer activity due to plummeting oil prices. Halliburton closed its Elmendorf facility and is relocating operations to field camps in southern Texas. The Houston-based company is also closing a Kilgore center and moving operations to Bossier City, Louisiana. The number of people laid off at the Elmendorf location was not immediately available. But a Texas Workforce Commission notice says 233 workers have been laid off at the Kilgore facility. The closures and layoffs are due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has cut global demand for oil and gas marking a historic industry downturn. “We recognize that this decision will be a hardship for impacted employees, but unfortunately, this was a necessary decision to right size our organization to current market conditions,” Halliburton spokeswoman Emily Mir said in a statement. On Tuesday, Halliburton laid off 240 employees from a service center in Duncan, Oklahoma, according to the Oklahoma Office of Workforce Development. The company laid off 350 personnel at the same facility earlier this month. Halliburton reported losing $1 billion during the first quarter and laying off 5,000 people. The company has laid off nearly 1,500 employees from Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and Louisiana in April, filings with state officials show.',\n",

       "  'summary': \"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Four Alaska oil field service companies have alerted state officials that they will lay off workers at their North Slope operations after oil prices crashed and drilling activity declined because of the coronavirus pandemic. The job cuts include 63 layoffs at Baker Hughes Co., 81 at Schlumberger Technology Corp., about 80 at Halliburton Energy Services Inc. and more than 50 at the Peak Oilfield Service Co., Alaska’s Energy Desk reported Wednesday. The companies sent the layoff notices to the state officials over the past month and the most recent notice was filed Monday. The layoffs include heavy equipment operators, engineers, technicians and mechanics, the notices said. Companies providing oil field services and equipment nationwide are cutting jobs and bracing for bankruptcy filings as the pandemic delivers a devastating blow to the oil and gas industry. Baker Hughes, Schlumberger and Halliburton have dismissed workers and slashed spending at operations across the globe. “I think that’s just the first glance at what’s coming,” said Rebecca Logan, chief executive of the Alaska Support Industry Alliance, an oil and mining trade group. Recent months included a “double whammy” for service companies on Alaska's North Slope, Logan said. The first blow came when virus and related travel restrictions complicated typical two-week work rotations for the Alaska workers. Companies also lowered their operations to essential functions to reduce the number of workers at the oil field camps. Then came a rapid drop in global oil prices, Logan said. “That pretty much took the wind out of everyone’s sails,” Logan said. “Now there’s not really work to go back to.” Alaska had an estimated 6,350 oil industry service jobs in 2019,...\",\n",

       "  'summary': 'It has already been a turbulent year for Disney (NYSE:DIS). DIS stock dropped 29% this year, after plummeting 46% at the height of the novel coronavirus-fueled selloff in March. The pandemic has temporarily hobbled many of its lines of business, and forced its retired CEO to step back into the limelight. On May 5, the company reports its second quarter earnings -- an event that will highlight the damage the coronavirus pandemic has done. Those numbers are going to have an immediate impact on the stock.Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com Just to recap, here\\'s an overview of the many challenges that will be manifesting themselves when Disney talks Q2 earnings. Numerous Challenges Bearing Down on DIS StockMovie Release ChaosInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCoronavirus lockdowns have shuttered movie theaters across the country and thrown movie release schedules into chaos. Disney had one big release that got caught right in middle of things. Pixar\\'s Onward made $50 million on its opening weekend, then theaters began to close. Trying to make the best of the situation, Disney quickly released the movie digitally for $19.99 and two weeks later, made it available for free on its Disney+ streaming service.Since then, Disney has had to delay the theatrical release of blockbuster Marvel movies. Black Widow has moved from May 1 to Nov. 6, and that has caused a ripple effect that stretches well into 2021. Disney\\'s big-budget live action reboot of Mulan was also rescheduled from March 27 to July 24.Theme Park ClosuresOn March 16, Disney announced its U.S. theme parks would temporarily close due to the pandemic. On March 27, the company updated the policy, closing Disneyland and Disney World \"until further notice.\" That move eventually resulted in Disney furloughing 43,000 park employees.A re-opening date for Disneyland in California remains uncertain. However, with Florida beginning to ease restrictions, there is speculation that Disney World could begin ramping up for a limited opening (at 50% guest capacity) within weeks.Disney Cruises CancelledCruise lines like Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) have been hammered by the coronavirus. Disney\\'s cruise operations were also early casualties of the pandemic. The company\\'s fleet: Disney Magic, Disney Wonder, Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy are docked, with all cruises cancelled until at least mid-June.No Sports for ESPNESPN is one of Disney\\'s more lucrative holdings, bringing in roughly $11 billion yearly in revenue. With sporting events cancelled and professional sports leagues suspending play during the coronavirus pandemic, ESPN has been severely challenged for content. The question is, will subscribers keep paying a premium for repeats of past games, or have they begun ditching ESPN until live sports return? Expect to hear an update on this situation on May 5.Disney+One bright point for DIS stock is Disney+, the company\\'s new video streaming service. After launching in Europe in late March, Disney+ has now nearly doubled its subscriber base during the pandemic -- hitting 50 million at the start of April. Not bad for five months since launch. Disney originally targeted hitting between 60 million and 90 million subscribers by 2024. The demand from entertainment-starved families locked indoors during the pandemic has helped growth accelerate faster than expected. So has the early availability of movies likes Frozen 2 and Onward on the service.Disney Q2 EarningsAll of this brings us to Disney\\'s Q2 earnings, which the company will report on May 5. In Q1, the company beat analyst expectations on both revenue and earnings, and saw quarterly revenue up 36.3% year-over-year.Given all things coronavirus-related, DIS is going to be feeling the impact, so no-one is expecting anything nearly so rosy. Analyst estimates for the quarter are revenue of $18 billion (up from $14.9 billion). Earnings are expected to take the real hit, though. Analysts are projecting EPS of 83 cents compared to $1.61 for Q2 2019.China Tension Ratchets Up AgainJust when it seemed as though it had faded from headlines, the U.S. trade war with China appears to be heating up again. President Trump is reportedly planning to punish China over its involvement with the coronavirus pandemic.Disney has previously warned that the trade war with China is damaging to its business, affecting film, merchandise sales, and Disneyland Shanghai -- which is only partially re-opened after being closed during that country\\'s coronavirus lockdown.Any escalation won\\'t have an impact on Disney\\'s Q2 numbers, but if this situation worsens in May it could be felt in Q3.    The Bottom Line on DisneyBernstein rates DIS as market perform with a price target of $100. That\\'s conservative compared to the 28 analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal. They have Disney stock rated as overweight, with a $126.12 average 12-month price target. That\\'s well below the $140 level DIS stock was trading at before the pandemic hit, but still offers a nice bit of upside. However that may change based on what Disney reports on May 5.Brad Moon has been writing for InvestorPlace.com since 2012. He also writes about stocks for Kiplinger and has been a senior contributor focusing on consumer technology for Forbes since 2015. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

       "  'summary': '(Bloomberg) -- Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund has been bulking up on stocks that got hammered during March’s historic market decline, adding to stakes in companies such as Carnival Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.The fund has acquired holdings of 5% or more in seven U.S.-traded companies since mid-March, according to filings by Oslo-based Norges Bank. The list includes Australian mining giant BHP Group Ltd. and Liberty Broadband Corp. as well as Shell, where the Norwegian fund doubled its holding.Shell and cruise operator Carnival are in two of the industries hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic -- energy and tourism. Saudi Arabia’s $320 billion Public Investment Fund, another sovereign money manager built from petroleum revenue, also invested in Carnival and Shell amid the global stock swoon, suggesting that investors with lengthy time horizons see brighter prospects ahead.“There has been a lot of volatility in the last three or four months, but Norges Bank thinks long term,” said Peter Fusaro, the chairman of Global Change Associates, a New York-based energy advisory firm. “Shell is actually not only looking at oil and gas assets, but positioning themselves for a cleaner energy future.”The Norwegian fund’s stake in Shell Class B shares reached 5% on March 24, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, up from the 2.55% at the end of last year. While Shell’s Class B American depositary shares have rebounded from a low of $19.58 each on March 18, they’re still well below an early January price of almost $62.Norges Bank Investment Management, which oversees the fund on behalf of the central bank, declined to comment.Saudi Arabia’s fund has been on its own buying frenzy in recent weeks, having set up a dedicated team to look for bargains. The Saudi vehicle’s latest investments include $1 billion of shares in European energy companies such as Shell and Norway’s Equinor ASA.The Norway fund’s buying may have been less opportunistic than that of the Saudis, said Patrick Schena, co-head of SovereigNet, the sovereign wealth initiative at Tufts University’s Fletcher School. The fund is required to keep roughly 70% of assets in equities and devote the remainder to fixed income and real estate, a ratio that can get out of balance when markets plunge or soar.“When the value of their assets decline, you will see them undergo significant portfolio rebalancing,” Schena said. “It’s not typical that Norges Bank would be taking opportunistic positions.”Created to invest Norway’s oil and gas revenue abroad, the fund in 2017 proposed divesting its oil stocks to help reduce Norway’s exposure to crude prices. The government eventually watered down the plan, sparing large integrated energy companies such as Shell.Having recently tightened its restrictions on coal investments, Norway’s fund proceeded in March to also raise its BHP stake to 5% from 3.8% at the end of last year. BHP, along with other big miners, has presented measures over the past year to lower its carbon footprint, and has also begun considering future options for its thermal coal operations.In April, the Norwegian fund reported reaching the 5% ownership threshold at Morristown, New Jersey-based waste management company Covanta Holding Corp. and Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte SAB, a Mexican airport operator whose American depositary shares trade on the Nasdaq. The fund disclosed 5% stakes earlier this week in Fitbit Inc. and Liberty Broadband.The Norwegian fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth vehicle, on average owns 1.5% of global listed equities. Through the end of last year, the fund’s annual return since inception has averaged 6.1%, according to its website. Its 15% loss in the first quarter, driven by the slide in equities, was its biggest ever.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

       "  'summary': 'As the novel coronavirus pandemic impacts economic activity and consumer sentiment, it\\'s about survival for companies in several sectors. In particular, sectors like energy, airline, cruising and tourism are severely impacted. Carnival (NYSE:CCL) stock has witness significant correction in the current year with the cruising activity almost coming to a haltSource: Ruth Peterkin / Shutterstock.com However, in the recent past, CCL stock has seen some positive momentum. I believe the stock has more upside from oversold levels.From a macroeconomic perspective, the U.S. is likely to get back to work relatively soon. Scott Atlas, former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University, has been calling for the lockdown to end. A staggered exit from the lockdown is likely to boost equity markets and the worst hit sectors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the flipside, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued orders that prevent cruising in U.S. waters until July. However, that\\'s not a concern as long as the economy gradually gets back to its feet. A Strong Liquidity BufferThe primary reason to be positive on Carnival is the company\\'s ability to navigate the crisis. In the recent past, the company has ramped up its liquidity.In March 2020, the company has drawn dawn its $3 billion multi-currently revolving credit facility. Additionally, the company closed its private offering of $4 billion in senior secured notes due 2023. Another private offering of $1.95 billion in convertible senior notes was closed in April 2020.Incorporating the proceeds from the common stock offering, the company has nearly $9.5 billion in liquidity buffer.Wedbush analyst James Hardiman believes that CCL is likely to have a monthly cash burn of $500 million. This implies an annual cash burn of $6 billion. A similar view comes from UBS analyst Robin Farley who believes that the company can stay afloat for 12-13 months in a zero-revenue scenario.Further, if the industry conditions remain depressed, aggressive cost cutting is likely. I expect monthly cash burn to reduce. Overall, survival is not a concern for Carnival. As the lockdown is lifted, focus should shift to gradual revenue growth. This is likely to take CCL stock higher.From the perspective of capital expenditure, Carnival Corporation has new ship capital expenditure of $4.8 billion for FY2020. In addition, the company has a capital expenditure of $3.6 billion for the coming year. In all probability, the capital expenditure for the current year will be deferred. This will help in conserving liquidity. A Positive Outlook Beyond the CrisisThere are several factors that make Carnival attractive for the long term.It\\'s worth noting that people are still booking for cruises for the next year. According to reports: In the last 45 days, CruiseComplete.com an online cruise marketplace, has seen a 40% increase in bookings for 2021 compared with 2019. Carnival CEO Arnold Donald has also commented on \"substantial bookings\" for the company for the coming year.Another factor that supports my bullish view is the low penetration in the cruising industry. As of 2019, the market penetration for North America was 3.89%. For Europe and Asia Pacific, the penetration was 1.41% and 0.2% respectively. This leaves ample room for upside in cruising.Specific to Carnival, the company is considering cutting passenger capacity in its cruise ships. While this will impact revenue, it makes cruises relatively safer from the coronavirus perspective. The Bottom Line on CCL StockFor FY2019, Carnival reported cash interest expenses of $171 million. The company recently raised $4 billion at an interest rate of 11.5%. In other words, the company\\'s leverage will increase in the coming quarters along with an increase in debt servicing cost. This will eat into the company\\'s profitability amidst equity dilution.However, even with this risk factor, the stock is depressed and can rally from current levels. Importantly, if cruising does witness gradual revival in 2021.Overall, there are challenges for Carnival. The most important ones being return of traveler confidence and impact of leverage beyond the crisis. However, CCL stock trades 75% below its 52-week highs and there is scope for upside even with the headwinds.Faisal Humayun is a senior research analyst with 12 years of industry experience in the field of credit research, equity research and financial modeling.

Over the past month, the stock spiked by 90.57%, but over the past year, it actually decreased by 63.85%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio.The stock is currently above from its 52 week low by 145.93%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Travel Services stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year.The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P; 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.Most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 9.41 in the travel services industry, Royal Caribbean Cruises has a lower P/E ratio of 5.37. Shareholders might be inclined to think that they might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.There are many limitations to price to earnings ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company. Shareholders might not get what they're looking for, from trailing earnings.See more from Benzinga  * 16 Consumer Cyclical Stocks Moving In Tuesday's Pre-Market Session  * 11 Consumer Cyclical Stocks Moving In Wednesday's Pre-Market Session  * 6 Consumer Cyclical Stocks Moving In Thursday's Pre-Market Session(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

       "  'summary': \"Friday had plenty of big movers for us to pick from. That said, let's look at a few top stock trades for next week.  Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Apple (AAPL)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comShares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are struggling to rally on Friday, despite beating on earnings. Keep in mind, the overall market was under pressure too, while Apple is up big from the March lows. All things considered, Friday's performance wasn't that bad. From here, though, Apple rests at an interesting spot. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares sit on steep uptrend support (blue line) with the 10-day moving average not far below, at $283. A move below opens the stock up to a decline to the $270 level. There AAPL will find its 50-day moving average and 50% retracement. It would be encouraging to see this level act as support. If it doesn't, however, the 200-day moving average may be the next stop.  * 7 Smart Stocks to Watch as Volatility Stays Soaring On the upside, Apple needs to take out the $300 to $305 zone.  Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Exxon Mobil (XOM)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is also in retreat on Friday, but fell much harder than Apple -- ending the day down more than 7% after a surprise Q1 loss. Like Apple, Exxon shares have an important level coming up. Near $43, XOM stock has its 50-day moving average and uptrend support mark (blue line). If that level holds, Exxon may rebound higher and retest recent resistance near $47.50. Above resistance and the 50% retracement near $50.25 is possible. On the downside, though, a drop to the 23.6% retracement at $39.61 may be on the table should support give way. Keep in mind, oil may be a driving force of Exxon's stock price. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Tesla (TSLA)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares took it on the chin on Friday, a day after a painful post-earnings reversal. This time, the selling pressure came from a questionable string of tweets from CEO Elon Musk. In any regard, the stock is seeing a solid bounce off uptrend support (blue line), despite the heavy decline. If TSLA can hold $700, see if the stock can reclaim the 10-day moving average and push up to $800. On the downside, a move back below $700 and uptrend support puts the 50% retracement in play. Below that and Tesla may visit its 50-day moving average at $632.   Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 4: American Airlines (AAL)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAmerican Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) took a dive on Friday, falling more than 11%. As a result, shares continue to look unhealthy. Shares are putting in a series of lower highs, a bearish technical development highlighted on the chart with purple arrows. A move below $10 puts the April low of $9.09 in play. On the upside, bulls need to see AAL end its streak of lower highs. To do so, it must get to $12.90 or higher. It would also be beneficial to see American Air close over its 50-day moving average. Right now, this chart is not enticing from the long side.  Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Western Digital (WDC)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAs is the theme today, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is also taking it on the chin -- down more than 12%. However, it's seeing a decent bounce off the lows, reclaiming the $40 level. Above $37.50 and technically speaking, Western Digital is okay. That said, it has a lot of overhead resistance. That includes the 10-day, 20-day and 50-day moving averages, the 38.2% and 50% retracements and range resistance between $47 and $48. If WDC can clear $50, it can fill the gap up to $52.50 and possibly run to the 200-day moving average. But man, the stock needs to do a lot in order to get there. Below $37.50 and it could fill a different gap down toward $33.80. Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, he was long AAPL.

       "  'summary': 'President Donald Trump\\'s administration bailed out American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), but it can\\'t make people fly. It also can\\'t single-handedly save AAL stock.Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com A $5.8 billion check from the government keeps the company out of bankruptcy. Another $4.8 billion loan may come soon.This gets American Airlines through the worst of the novel coronavirus pandemic. It means the company is back to flying.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut that doesn\\'t make AAL stock worth buying. The New Normal for AAL StockIn its earnings report for the March quarter, American reported a loss of $2.2 billion. This was cut in half through non-cash write-downs of aircraft which were taken out of service, and special deals with its unions. The airline said it ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of liquidity and that government aid means it will end June with $11 billion.  * 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades Those bullish on the airline insist \"data continues to support COVID-19 as only slightly above the seasonal flu.\" This is based on the idea that, if everyone were being tested, only 0.1% of those who have the virus would die.A federal grant will pay American Airlines\\' employees through September. It can now break even on just $2.2 billion of revenue each quarter, 20% of its previous level, flying planes at 30% capacity.To get traffic to that level, American has announced new cleaning procedures. It will give passengers sanitizing wipes and face masks. Passengers will be required to wear masks starting May 11.Meanwhile the airline is facing a surge of Covid-19 cases among ground personnel. Thousands of pilots and flight attendants have taken early retirement. The government calls the impact of the virus on the industry \"worse than 9/11,\" justifying the giveaway. If You Fly Planes, Will Passengers Come?The question is, with the airline propped up by the government, will people fly?Right now, the answer is no. The number of passengers going through airport security at the end of April was just 5% of its level from a year ago, about 129,000. American is flying more long-haul cargo than people.Long before the virus, airlines were publicizing their air circulation, trying to alleviate passenger concerns. Airline cabin air is refreshed 20 times per hour, running through HEPA filters, with separate ventilation every seven rows. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention insists viruses don\\'t spread easily on planes.While HEPA filters are effective against bacteria, Covid-19 is caused by a virus, which is much smaller. A visualization making the rounds on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) shows that a single cough, recirculated, can spread the virus throughout the cabin of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 767. Worse, people can be shedding the virus without symptoms. Banning sick people from planes will not, by itself, prevent this spread.There are long-term fixes. Putting air circulation systems in the floor of the cabin can help. Columbia University is experimenting with ultraviolet light. Boeing has been working on self-cleaning bathrooms. But none of these innovations will be available in 2020.The question is whether all this publicity will get people back on planes, and when? The government bailout won\\'t last through the fourth quarter. The Bottom Line on American AirlinesBuying AAL stock today is a speculation. Normal investment rules do not apply.The market capitalization for American is down to about $4.5 billion, against $8.5 billion of revenue in the first quarter. But those results represent just one month under the pandemic. In the post-pandemic world, $8.5 billion could be a full year\\'s revenue.The bailout was also short term. Many people objected to it, noting the large dividends and buybacks American engaged in when times were flush.If American Airlines can become profitable at 30% of pre-pandemic capacity by September, it may be able to grow from there. That\\'s what you\\'re betting on if you buy AAL stock today. Just don\\'t make bets with money you can\\'t afford to lose.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

       "  'summary': '(Bloomberg) -- American Airlines Group Inc. received a big blow from Wall Street on Friday as Evercore ISI analyst Duane Pfennigwerth slashed his price target on the Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier to $1 from $10.That would imply a 92% rout in the stock, which closed at $12.01 on Thursday.The airline, which entered the coronavirus-fueled crisis with the weakest balance sheet in the group, may not see “meaningful” recovery in its share price, the analyst said. As American, and the entire industry, tries to raise additional liquidity, Evercore estimates its net debt will far exceed revenue by the end of this year.American’s total debt stood at a little more than $34 billion as of March 31.Pfennigwerth expects American’s net debt to Ebitdar ratio to stand at about 9.8 times on reduced 2021 estimates. The analyst now expects a 2020 loss per share of $13.90, compared to a prior estimate of a $6.90/share loss, and a 2021 loss/share of $1.55, down from a profit estimate of 75c.“Parts of American’s earnings call yesterday struck us as out of sync with the severity of this crisis, such as the unwillingness to put a long-term network restructuring on the table,” the Evercore analyst wrote, adding that “equity investors may not be the target audience for these earnings calls anymore.”While all airlines have seen their stocks decimated thanks to the coronavirus outbreak causing travel demand to dwindle, American has been among those hit especially hard. The S&P; Supercomposite Airlines Industry Index is down a staggering 56% since mid-February, when the virus-related market selloff began. United and American are the two biggest decliners in the index so far, falling 65% and 60%, respectively. The S&P; 500 Index is down 16% over the same period.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

       "  'summary': \"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett will\\xa0address\\xa0his followers on Saturday for the first time since the U.S. began implementing the state-by-state lockdowns that have upended the economy and life as we knew it. Technically, it’s the annual\\xa0Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholder meeting, though much will be missing from this year’s event —\\xa0people, for starters. Even so,\\xa0the main draw of the weekend lives on: the chance to\\xa0pick one of the most brilliant brains in business.In a live-streamed interview that evening, Buffett will answer\\xa0questions submitted by investors, including presumably how\\xa0the conglomerate’s various lines of business have been affected by the pandemic. But what\\xa0listeners are really tuning in for are the Oracle of Omaha’s broader views on the world during a time like this.\\xa0Here are five questions for him:1\\\\. Is it time to name a successor?Or has he essentially done so? For the first time, Buffett is doing the Q&A; jointly with Greg Abel, a Berkshire vice chairman, rather than his usual sidekick, Charlie Munger, who is 96 years old and resides in California. Buffett, who will turn 90 in August, even joked in his February letter to shareholders that he and Munger are in “the urgent zone.”\\xa0All signs point to Abel being the next CEO of Berkshire, but Buffett\\xa0hasn’t spelled out the succession plan yet. It was going to be hard enough for shareholders to get comfortable with anyone other than him\\xa0someday being the steward of their money. With all the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, now is a good\\xa0time for Buffett\\xa0to clarify why Abel\\xa0is best suited to manage the conglomerate, even through a crisis like this.2\\\\. Could the concept of a “new normal” alter what kinds of investments Berkshire makes in the future?If Buffett isn’t using his enforced isolation at home to hunt\\xa0for another elephant-sized acquisition, is that because the Covid-19 shutdowns are causing him to reevaluate what types of businesses will recover? Or is he perhaps grappling\\xa0with the potential for long-term changes in customer behavior? Taking a stake in the Kroger Co. supermarket chain late last year proved to be prescient; buying preferred stock in oil producer Occidental Petroleum Corp. not so much. Those circumstances would still seem to be temporary. Air travel, on the other hand, is an example of an industry where a return to normal could take awhile —\\xa0or never even come.\\xa03\\\\. Will the airline industry ever rebound?\\xa0Buffett has a tormented history with airlines. After getting burned once\\xa0by a US Airways investment, Buffett swore off the industry in 2001, saying: “Now if I get the urge to invest in airlines, I call an 800 number and I say: Hello, my name is Warren, and I'm an air-o-holic.” Well, Buffett apparently lost that number and went all in on airline stocks in 2016. Berkshire is now the largest shareholder of Delta Air Lines Inc., the second-largest owner of United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co., and has the third-biggest stake in American Airlines Group Inc. They’ve all plunged this year as the pandemic wreaked havoc on air travel —\\xa0or any travel at all.On March 10, during a Yahoo Finance interview, Buffett said he “won’t be selling airline stocks.” That was before the shutdowns. A few weeks later, Berkshire reduced its Delta and Southwest positions, although it’s still the No. 1 and No. 2 investor in each. An update on his thinking would be especially illuminating now.4\\\\. Covid-19 has forced the nation to reassess and recognize what it means to be an “essential” worker. Does that warrant new ideas for solving wealth inequality? Buffett himself employs a lot of essential workers: They’re manning freight trains that are still pushing goods around the country, as well as\\xa0manufacturing Duracell batteries. Lubrizol — which makes chemicals used for everything from coating car interiors to yoga pants — has helped to produce hand sanitizer, while Fruit of the Loom switched to making protective face masks. Berkshire is also the largest shareholder of food giant Kraft Heinz Co., one company helping to keep supermarkets stocked.\\xa0In that same March interview,\\xa0Buffett discussed the wealth gap,\\xa0saying\\xa0it’s a reflection of the fact that workers are rewarded based on the skills that are valued by the\\xa0market:You get this pushing of extreme rewards to people who are very, very good at something the market demands. And people demand entertainment. They demand people apparently that arbitrage securities. There's certain specialties.But they demand lots of basic things, too, as this pandemic has shown.Even though Buffett agrees with letting the system function the way it does, “we don’t want people left behind,” he said. The billionaire\\xa0has often advocated for an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit as a better way of putting more money in the pockets of low-income families than through hiking the minimum wage. That’s because the latter could backfire by increasing unemployment. The\\xa0EITC just doesn’t have the same ring to it as $15, and it’s not as easily understood as earning more per hour. Buffett has\\xa0also called for higher taxes on the ultra-wealthy, like himself.\\xa05\\\\. Do America’s best days still lie ahead?Buffett has seen his share of crises, and they’ve never seemed to shake\\xa0his optimism that the U.S. will continue to prosper in the long run. “America’s best days lie ahead,” is a mantra he often repeats in his annual letters to shareholders. But Buffett has been unusually quiet during the pandemic —\\xa0in terms of a lack of both TV appearances (perhaps due to virus fears) and deal activity. Investors could use a reminder of how the country’s biggest cheerleader and hungriest dealmaker feels about its long-term prospects. Is it possible they are changing?\\xa0This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

       "  'summary': 'Boeing (NYSE:BA) delivered its first-quarter results on April 29. The numbers were ugly, as you might expect for a company largely reliant on selling airplanes at a time when the novel coronavirus pandemic is hammering airlines. In addition, Boeing stock continues to suffer fallout from the self-inflicted 737-MAX disaster.Source: Alex JW Robinson / Shutterstock.com Despite a big revenue drop, worse-than-expected losses, a big leap in debt levels, and the announcement of layoffs, Boeing stock actually gained ground on Wednesday.   If that sounds contradictory to what the company reported, it\\'s probably a case of the market expecting the news to be much worse than it was.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Boeing Delivers Q1 Earnings, BA PopsBoeing delivered its earnings for the first quarter of 2020 on Wednesday, and the market reaction was somewhat surprising. The company missed on revenue, reporting $16.9 billion versus the expected $17.1 billion. That\\'s a 26% year-over-year drop. The adjusted loses per share of $1.70 were also worse than analysts had been expecting. While burning through $4.3 billion in cash for the quarter, the company took on more than $10 billion in debt. That raises its total debts to $38.9 billion.  * 30 Stocks on a DeathwatchThe company noted that share buybacks and dividends have been suspended. Adding to the bad news for the quarter was an announcement of layoffs, with the company targeting a 10% reduction in its workforce.The results reflect a business being hit by a one-two punch of the 737 MAX situation and the novel coronavirus pandemic. Those factors combined for a delivery of just 50 planes in Q1, down 66%.Boeing CEO David Calhoun tried to sound a positive note:\"While Covid-19 is adding unprecedented pressure to our business, we remain confident in our long-term future. We continue to support our defense customers in their critical national security missions. We are progressing toward the safe return to service of the 737 MAX, and we are driving safety, quality and operational excellence into all that we do every day. Air travel has always been resilient, our portfolio of products and technology is well-positioned, and we are confident we will emerge from the crisis and thrive again as a leader of our industry.\"The good news in Boeing\\'s Q1 earnings was a total backlog of over 5,000 commercial plans. Those orders represent $439 billion in revenue. However, there is a risk that order backlog could shrink. Airlines have continued to cancel 737 MAX orders. If the coronavirus pandemic continues to ground flights, even giants like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) will be rethinking planned expenditures on new aircraft. The Bottom Line on Boeing StockIf things sound a little dire for Boeing\\'s long-term prospects, there is still optimism that the company can turn things around. In November, Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management professor Tim Calkin told NPR:\"If you take the right steps today, I think Boeing can come across as a brand that is still strong, is still trusted, and maybe is better for all of this. But if you don\\'t (take the right steps), it creates deep, long-term problems for the company.\"Most investment analysts continue to have Boeing stock rated as a hold at this point, while they wait to see what happens next. Its pop yesterday seems more like a \"it could have been worse\" reaction than the start of that hoped-for recovery. With BA down 60% since its February high close of $347.45, off by 63% over the past 12 months, and at its lowest level since 2016, now could be seen as a buying opportunity.But only if you have confidence that the situation for the company isn\\'t going to worsen. And at the moment -- with air travel at a virtual standstill, Boeing taking on $10 billion in debt, layoffs, and the 737 MAX still grounded -- that\\'s a big leap of faith. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

       "  'summary': '(Bloomberg) -- American Airlines Group Inc. is doubling down on government aid even as rivals expand their funding sources with sales of shares and bonds.The largest carrier based on passenger traffic has been absent amid a recent flurry of activity in debt and equity markets tapped by Delta Air Lines Inc., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. Instead, American is focused on negotiating a $4.75 billion loan from the U.S. Treasury Department. Like other carriers, American has already gotten U.S. payroll aid, taking $5.8 billion in grants and loans.Airlines have been devastated as fear of the highly contagious virus and government-imposed traffic restrictions have erased 95% of passenger traffic compared with a year ago. American, already burdened by industry-leading debt of about $30 billion, is burning through about $70 million in cash each day, a figure it expects to decline to $50 million in June.“American’s liquidity position is dependent on government aid, bucking the trends we’ve seen from other airlines,” Helane Becker, a Cowen & Co. analyst, said in a note Thursday. The carrier “will likely have to raise more cash given current demand, cash burn level, and 2021 refinancing needs.”American fell 5.6% to $11.92 at 2:22 p.m. in New York. The shares tumbled 56% this year through Wednesday, the second-worst performance among a Standard & Poor’s index of the five largest U.S. carriers.Grave Situation“The uncertainty about the future weighs on everyone, and for good reason,” Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said in a letter to employees as the carrier reported first-quarter results Thursday. “There is no way to overstate the gravity of the situation for the airline industry and the difficult decisions that are ahead of all of us.”American already has trimmed $12 billion from operating and capital spending this year by slashing flying capacity 80% this month and next, parking aircraft and speeding up the retirement of older planes, freezing hiring and cutting executive pay. Nearly 39,000 workers have taken leave, retired early or accepted reduced hours.Now the carrier’s “sole focus is to insure we have sufficient liquidity,” Chief Financial Officer Derek Kerr said. Securing the Treasury loan will bring American’s available funds by the end of this quarter to $11 billion, “which is going to compare favorably to anyone,” Parker said.That number includes both the $5.8 billion in payroll aid and the pending federal loan. American’s three largest competitors also received some amount of a combined grant and loan from the U.S. Treasury Department to help offset labor costs in addition to other options for raising cash.Efficient OptionParker said he views the government loan process as the most efficient way for American to improve its liquidity at this point. “We could do some other things, but what we think the right way to sequence it for us is to get the $4.75 billion from the government,” he said.American has about $10 billion in unencumbered assets, excluding the value of its AAdvantage loyalty program. An unspecified portion of those assets will be used to secure the federal loan. The carrier isn’t considering an equity sale at this time.Delta secured $5 billion this week, including a $3.5 billion offering of senior secured notes originally intended to raise $1.5 billion, and a term loan agreement, according to a regulatory filing. Delta will have $12 billion in liquidity by the end of this quarter. While it’s submitted an application for a $4.6 billion Treasury loan, the airline has until September to decide whether to accept the funding. Delta has said it doesn’t plan an equity offering at this time.Issuing StockSouthwest tapped the bond market Wednesday for $2 billion of new debt, just one day after raising about $4 billion by issuing stock and convertible notes. Southwest has said it will apply for a $2.8 billion government loan, but will defer a decision on accepting it. United raised $1 billion from the sale of new shares on April 21, the first equity offering by a major carrier during the coronavirus pandemic. United also wants to apply for a U.S. loan, but hasn’t said if it will take it.Parker acknowledged that American will be smaller coming out of the pandemic, echoing executives at Delta and Southwest. American won’t close any of its airport hubs, but it will be evaluating whether employee furloughs will be necessary, executives said. Parker expects a “long, drawn-out recovery” but reiterated he believes the crisis has bottomed.“It’s hard to imagine any lower demand for air travel than we’ve seen the last few weeks,” he said. There have been recent glimmers of improvement.American has seen an uptick in bookings for travel within seven days, although not a significant amount, as well as for bookings 90 days ahead of travel, he said.The carrier reported a first-quarter adjusted loss of $1.1 billion, or $2.65 a share -- it’s first since emerging from bankruptcy and merging with US Airways in December 2013. Revenue fell nearly 20%.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

       "  'summary': \"DALLAS (AP) — American Airlines reported a staggering loss of $2.24 billion for the first quarter, when the coronavirus pandemic triggered a sharp drop in air travel. The airline's revenue fell 19% while costs continued to rise even as the virus spread. The situation facing the airline industry has grown more dire since the first quarter ended. Air travel within the U.S. has plunged 95% from a year ago, judging by the number of people screened at the nation's airports. “Never before has our airline, or our industry, faced such a significant challenge,” Chairman and CEO Doug Parker said. American's massive loss compared with a profit of $185 million in the same quarter last year. American said that adjusted for non-recurring items, it lost $2.65 per share. That was worse than the average forecast of a $2.08 per share loss from 15 analysts surveyed by FactSet. Investors, however, seemed prepared for the bad news. In premarket trading, shares of American Airlines Group Inc. rose 1%. Parker highlighted American's efforts to bolster its liquidity — building up enough cash, it hopes, to ride out the pandemic — including getting $5.8 billion in federal aid to help cover payroll costs through September. American estimated that it ended March with $6.8 billion in cash and other liquidity, including $2 billion that it raised during the first quarter, and will have $11 billion at the end of June. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline has cut its flying schedule by 80% in April and May and 70% in June. It has grounded hundreds of planes. Nearly 39,000 employees have accepted early retirement, partially paid leave or fewer hours of work. Cheaper fuel caused by the collapse in energy prices will contribute to a reduction of more than $12 billion in its 2020 spending, the...\",\n",

       "  'summary': 'American Airlines Group Inc.  said Thursday it had a net loss of $2.241 billion, or $5.26 a share, in the first quarter, after earnings of $185 million, or 41 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. The airline said it\\'s adjusted per-share loss came to $2.65, compared with a FactSet consensus for a loss per share of just $2.08. Revenue fell 19.6% to $8.515 billion from $10.584 billion. The FactSet consensus was for revenue of $9.255 billion. \"Never before has our airline, or our industry, faced such a significant challenge,\" Chief Executive Doug Parker said in a statement. Like its rivals, American has been hammered as consumers have stopped flying during the coronavirus pandemic with many states and regions under strict lockdown regimes to prevent the spread of the illness. \"We have moved quickly and aggressively to reduce our costs and bolster our liquidity,\" Parker said. The carrier ended the quarter with $6.8 billion in liquidity, and has access to $10.8 billion in financial assistance through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The company said it views its unencumbered assets as having a value of more than $10 billion and expects to pledge some of those as collateral for future financing, including the roughly $4.75 billion secured loan it has applied for under the CARES Act. It expects its second-quarter cash burn to come to about $70 million a day. The airline has taken a series of measures to prepare for the gradual reopening of economies, including new cleaning protocols and ordering team members to wear face masks. It is extending travel waivers through the end of September. Shares rose 1.9% premarket but have fallen 69% in the year to date, while the S&P; 500  has fallen 10%.',\n",

       "  'summary': 'On Wednesday, beleaguered United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) received the first piece of substantive good news since the novel coronavirus destroyed the global economy. And UAL stock appreciated the breath of fresh air.Source: NextNewMedia / Shutterstock.com According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,  Gilead Sciences\\' (NASDAQ:GILD) drug remdesivir demonstrated encouraging results in terms of reducing recovery time from the coronavirus. As a result, the broader markets jumped higher, with a pronounced, double-digit effect on UAL stock.Of course, it wasn\\'t just United that saw some love. Competitors such as Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) also enjoyed double-digit gains in the midweek session. For the airliner industry, a viable coronavirus treatment represents a godsend. Due to its infectiousness, those who share the same air within tight quarters are presumably at higher risk of contraction.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsObviously, a treatment protocol would be cause for belief in the pent-up demand thesis for UAL stock. However, investors should use caution with this narrative. For one thing, Dr. Fauci\\'s support doesn\\'t necessarily mean that remdesivir will work as desired. Other tests showed a lack of efficacy or inconclusive results.So even if remdesivir stands up to further trials, ramping up scale is another challenge. And should the coronavirus return in the fall or winter as Dr. Fauci has suggested, there\\'s no clear system in place to determine who has taken the drug. In that case, UAL stock risks falling back into the same cloud of uncertainty it\\'s in today.  * 7 Smart Stocks to Buy Even During Coronavirus-Induced Volatility In addition, we\\'ve got to question the consumer\\'s willingness to travel again -- especially so soon after this crisis. With people forcibly stuck at home, most have likely grown accustomed to avoiding each other. And shifting that paradigm will take time. Unreal Demand Loss Will Plague UAL Stock and the AirlinersNow, some companies are racing to provide \"new normal\" solutions to reinvigorate consume confidence toward airliners. For instance, some airliners could adopt rear-facing plane seats to help maximize social distancing in confined spaces.It\\'s a creative idea. But even if people wanted to fly, many simply cannot. With the U.S. economy contracting nearly 5% in the first quarter -- and more pain on the way -- cash is king. And the reason why cash is king is because so few people have it.If they do, they\\'re not going to plunk it down on a vacation that could get them sick.This isn\\'t a stretch by any measure. Recently, my InvestorPlace articles have focused on hard data. And the most significant data point for airliners is the price of jet fuel. According to basic economic principles, if people want to fly, the price for jet fuel will increase.Instead, the opposite is happening -- and to a dubious, record-breaking degree. On March 13, the weekly change in jet fuel prices dipped to a loss of 26.3%. That is the worst week-over-week loss that the U.S. Energy Information Administration has on record.  Click to EnlargeFor context, the worst weekly loss during the Great Recession occurred on December 12, 2008. At that time, jet fuel prices \"only\" lost 13.4%.If that wasn\\'t bad enough, consider that between March 13 and April 24, we have four weekly sessions that incurred losses of 20% or worse. The average is nearly 24%. So honestly, you couldn\\'t have a more terrible situation for UAL stock.No matter what United does, they\\'re facing untenable circumstances. If they cut their prices to draw people back in, they lose margin. If they keep prices the same, no one will fly. Thus, UAL stock is really a bull trap. Even a Restored Economy Means Painful ChangesA few days ago, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) announced that they will require all passengers to wear a face covering. Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue\\'s president and chief operating officer, had some strong words, saying that this is the \"new flying etiquette.\"Frankly, I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, I believe most Americans -- particularly the younger generation -- are poorly reared by morally bankrupt parents. So on a personal level, I loved that Geraghty was dropping the hammer, during a pandemic of all times. What moxie!On the other hand, this points to the worrying trend that airliners must make drastic changes to accommodate the new normal. Many companies are experimenting with this, such as blocking out the middle seats. But in a market geared toward filling every airplane to the brink, how will this change the business model?In my opinion, probably very negatively. I\\'m not breaking new ground when I suggest we\\'ll see mass-scale consolidation here. But trying to figure out winners from losers in this incredibly dynamic sector is too much of a hassle for me. Therefore, I\\'m taking a pass on UAL stock.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

One passenger was taken off the plane but was not arrested, said Des Moines police Sgt.

(AP) — Spirit AeroSystems is offering voluntary layoffs to all its union-covered technical and professional workers in Wichita as the company continues to respond to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX and the coronavirus pandemic. It wasn't immediately clear how many jobs will be affected by the move, which was announced in an email to employees Wednesday night, The Wichita Eagle reported. The final day of work for those who take the buyout will be no later than May 14. Last year, the employees' union, the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, represented more than 1,600 technical and professional workers at Spirit, but the company has since announced several layoffs, early retirement offers and furloughs. The announcement comes after Boeing said Wednesday it would cut its workforce by 10% as the demand for new airplanes continues to drop during the coronavirus pandemic. Spirit spirit also is struggling because it makes about 70% of the Boeing 737 MAX, which was grounded last spring after two deadly crashes. The new voluntary layoffs are a “first step” in the company’s plans to deal with Boeing's announcement, according to the email from Spirit CEO Tom Gentile.\",\n",

       "  'summary': '(Bloomberg Opinion) -- What were they thinking, those publicly traded companies like Shake Shack Inc., Ruth’s Hospitality Group and dozens of others — companies that could hardly be called small — that grabbed a slice of the Paycheck Protection Program, an act for which they have been duly flogged?Actually, it’s not that hard to figure out: They grabbed the money because it was there to be grabbed. “To the extent we believe we are eligible and parts of the package will benefit the company, then we’ll look to pursue application options,” a Shake Shack representative told the Wall Street Journal soon after the PPP was passed by Congress.Thanks to lobbying by the restaurant and hotel industries, someone slipped a loophole into the bill making it possible for big chains to apply for funds. The companies had banking relationships that all but guaranteed that they would be at the head of the line when it came time to apply. Besides, they had furloughed employees to consider, just like local hair salons.In other words, they acted precisely the way companies always acted before the coronavirus outbreak. They were looking out for themselves, with little regard for anyone else. Yes, the program had been described from the start as aiming to benefit the truly small companies, the ones with no other access to capital. And yes, it was obvious that the initial $349 billion wasn’t nearly enough for the tens of thousands of small companies that needed federal help.But the rules were the rules, right? For instance, the rules allowed holding companies to apply separately for each subsidiary they controlled — and receive multiple multimillion-dollar checks. That’s what President Donald Trump’s pal Monty Bennett did: He got $58.7 million for various hotel properties he owns.And maybe, pre-coronavirus, that would have been the end of it. But the virus has made Americans acutely aware of inequities that had once been easy — or at least easier — to overlook. School closings sharpened awareness of the achievement gap between poor and well-to-do kids. Work-from-home policies helped keep white-collar employees safe\\xa0while many blue-collar workers had to risk illness and even death because they didn’t have that luxury. It had become obvious that the virus struck the vulnerable harder than people with means.The way that first round of PPP money was distributed seemed like yet another example of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. But this time, the hyperawareness brought on by the coronavirus led to an enormous outcry, which included newspaper exposes and condemnations from lawmakers and even Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.The publicity wasn’t just bad; it was horrible. Small-business people who had been shut out complained bitterly about how the PPP had been rigged for the bigger companies. Reporters found recipients with ties to Trump, like Bennett. Others looked through federal filings, searching for public companies that had taken PPP loans. (The Wall Street Journal found 124 of them, with a median PPP loan of $2.8 million.) One company that landed a $10 million loan was MiMedx, which had recently paid $6.5 million to settle charges brought by the Justice Department. Critics accused it of using its PPP loan to cover its settlement with the government. (MiMedx denied this.)Immediately, Shake Shack, a company founded by Danny Meyer, a highly respected restaurateur, gave back its $10 million. So did a number of other companies, including AutoNation, the Los Angeles Lakers, and, eventually, Ruth’s Hospitality. It wasn’t just because of the bad publicity, or at least I don’t think it was. It was because executives like Meyer realized that, even though Shake Shack had done nothing wrong, it was unfair that his company, with its $2.3 billion market value and $600 million in annual revenue, was taking money that so many smaller companies needed more.Of course, there are also companies that have not given the money back. In an effort to twist their arm, Mnuchin said that companies that have taken more than $2 million would be audited before the loan could be forgiven. (Loans can be forgiven if the companies keep their employees on the payroll for eight weeks.) He also said that companies that wrongfully took PPP money could face “criminal liability.”As threats go, that’s pretty weak, given that most of the companies simply took advantage of the language in the law. And most of the big companies that took loans can well afford to pay them back, thus avoiding the threatened audit. Nonetheless, they should still give the money back now.They should do so because they have access to capital — in the equity and debt markets, as well as from banks — that is out of the grasp of the ordinary small-business person. They should do it because big companies that run into financial trouble can reorganize under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, while a corner pizza joint simply goes out of business. They should do it because small business is a critical element of American life, a source not just of jobs but of community.They should do it for the simple reason that it’s the right thing to do.There are people who believe that this crisis could lead to a reset of the values that have driven the business world the last quarter-century. One of the few upsides of the crisis has been a surge in caring for our neighbors and our fellow citizens. For their part, corporations have talked about putting their employees first, even at the expense of profits. Many of them raced to supply equipment the country needs to fight the virus.The companies that have given back their PPP loans are showing that they, too, care for more than just their quarterly numbers. They did something to help small companies that will never affect their own bottom lines. The companies that haven’t given the money back? They’re showing that they’re not yet willing to look beyond their narrow self-interest.This is their test. Giving back the PPP money is the only way they can pass.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

       "  'summary': '(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.) Maria K. Watson, Texas A&M University (THE CONVERSATION) The U.S. government has committed hundreds of billions of dollars to help small businesses weather the coronavirus pandemic. But early reports suggest larger companies are gobbling up much of the aid, while many of the neediest ones – particularly those with only a few dozen employees – aren’t benefiting. For example, large, generally profitable companies like Shake Shack, Potbelly and even the Los Angeles Lakers, with access to other lines of credit, have received millions of dollars in loans, even as mom-and-pop stores across the U.S. say they are still waiting to hear back about their applications. Very small businesses, particularly those operating on small profit margins, are especially vulnerable, since they may not have the cash reserves to weather periods of economic uncertainty and typically have fewer ways to access financing. A recent poll by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that one in four U.S. businesses is two months away from permanently shutting down. My research on efforts to help businesses recover from hurricanes and other disasters shows why smaller organizations have long struggled to get aid after a crisis. Obstacles to aid Hurricane Ike, at the time of its impact in 2008, was the third-costliest storm in the nation’s history. It caused approximately US$30 billion in damages and devastated thousands of businesses in southeastern Texas. My colleagues and I focused our study in Galveston County, Texas, where Ike made its initial landfall and more than 3,800 businesses were interrupted and 53,000 employees were put out of work. The Small Business Administration has...',\n",
